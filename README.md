The project implements the pseudo-spectral methods and spectral element methods for nonlinear wave equations. The project grows over time when the author adds more and more solvers for different wave equations. Most of the code is developed throughout his teaching activities and publications. This instruction is thus updated as the project evolves.

Currently, there are two main folders:
(1) Spectral elements
