# Waves

The project implements the pseudo-spectral methods and spectral element methods for nonlinear wave equations. The project grows over time when the author adds more and more solvers for different wave equations. Most of the code is developed throughout his teaching activities and publications. This instruction is thus updated as the project evolves. Currently, there are two main folders: (1) sine-Gordon equation, (2) Pseudo-spectral methods.

- The folder (1) collects the functions implementing the spectral element method for 1D and 2D sine-Gordon equation.

- The folder (2) collects the code implementing the pseudo-spectral methods for many nonlinear dispersive wave equations. As of the time of this release, we solved the following equations:
  (2.1) Korteweg-de Vries equation
  (2.2) Nonlinear Schr√∂dinger equation
  (2.3) Benjamin-Ono equation
  (2.4) Benjamin equation
  (2.5) Calogero-Sutherland (CS) model

Please don't rate the supplied code if it is just because you cannot run the code. There might be inconcistencies in the system or the MATLAB version because we updated all the implementation with the MATLAB version 20202b. In that case, please contact the author at "herokhiem@yahoo.com" for more instructions and explanation. The author tries his best to make documentation clearn and understandable. Since the code is developed from his publications, it is not necessarily trivial to understand at the first sight. We tried to vectorize all of the computations as much as possible. Thus, the code appears compactly.
